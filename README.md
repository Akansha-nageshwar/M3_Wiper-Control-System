# M3_Wiper-Control-System

- This project is all about designing a wiper control system for cars.
- We use STM32cube IDE and Qemu for emulating the operation.
- As qemu supports only 4 LEDs and a Switch, we make use of LEDs to notify the operations.
- We denote intensity of rain by the frequency in which the lights alternate between the four colours.
- The switch indicates ON/OFF
